Jira Sprint Management

    Create a sprint and move backlog items into it:
Go to the Backlog of your project.

Click Create Sprint in the backlog section.

Drag and drop items (user stories, tasks) into the sprint.

When ready, click Start Sprint to begin the sprint.
Go to Active Sprint and click on Complete Sprint.

Jira will ask if you want to move incomplete issues to the next sprint. Confirm this option, and any remaining issues will be carried over.

    Onboard new members and assign project roles:

Go to Jira settings > User Management > Invite users.

Enter their email addresses and assign them appropriate roles (e.g., Developer, Scrum Master).

Make sure to provide them with access to the correct projects and boards.

    Set up a new Scrum project for a client and configure permissions:

Create a new Scrum project as described above.

After creating the project, go to Project settings > Permissions.

Assign the appropriate roles (e.g., Project Lead, Developer) to the client's team members and set up permissions to restrict or allow access as necessary.
